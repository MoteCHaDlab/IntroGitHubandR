# IntroGitHubandR
 
 Repository with information and resources for getting started using GitHub and R, along with the best practices for working in the MoteCHaDLab GitHub organization. 
 
 Disclaimer: I (Sara) am fairly new to collaborating on code using GitHub. This will be messy and we will learn together. Google is your (our) best friend.

## Getting Started with GitHub

### First Steps

1. Make a GitHub account if you don't have one already. https://github.com/

2. Send me (swilliams@mote.org) your account name
  a. If you still have a student email, you can get github pro for free: https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application

3. Download and install GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/

4. Check to make sure you have git on your computer
  a. on a mac, open up the terminal
  b. on a windows pc, open up the command prompt
  c. type 'git version' and enter, it should return your version if you have git.
  d. if you don't have git, https://github.com/git-guides/install-git 
  
### ... So what exactly are Git and GitHub?

**[Git](https://git-scm.com)** is a free and open source distributed version control system. Version control lets you track changes and go back to previous versions of files. You can recover your code after making a mistake and go back to a known good state. Now what about **[GitHub](https://github.com)**? It's a for-profit company / website and cloud-based service that helps you store and manage your code, as well as track changes (using git). It makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration since it is (mostly) user friendly. 

You can use git and github through the terminal/command prompt, BUT **[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** exists and provides a nice, easier to use interface. 

### Git-ting the lingo:

* Repository: The source code for a project. *Local* repository is where you edit your code (usually on your computer) and the *remote* repository is the place you send it after you're finished (i.e. GitHub).
* Commit: kind of like saving a file. It's a collection of content - anything you want to add. Goes with a commit message that explains what you changed
* Branch: version of the repository that diverges from the main working project where you can make your own commits without interrupting others working on the same repository. You can later *merge* the branch back in.
* Clone: make a copy of the target repository
* Fetch: gets the most updated version of a repository from the remote source
* Origin/Master: Default name for the default branch of your root directory, so like the initial location of everything in the repository from when it was created.
* Pull request: Ask the person in charge of the branch to include your code - let other know about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository
* Fork: create an entirely new repository by duplicating the repository being forked
* HEAD: points to the most recent commit on the current branch
* Merge: joins two or more commit histories

#### Forking vs. Branching?

Think of forking as divergent evolution of code and branching as convergent evolution of code... this metaphor mostly works. 

When you *fork* you are creating an entirely new repository by duplicating the repository being forked. You create a new origin/master. Forks are best for when the you intend to split and create an independent project, which will never reunite with its parent. Unless you are the one developing a tutorial/example repository in the organization, you should fork them. 

*Branches* are sort of like 'construction zones.' They are used to create a temporary place to work through a feature (like a code notebook) and make some changes that you plan on merging back with the origin branch later. Branching is something that you should consider using when actively collaborating on a code repository with a team.
