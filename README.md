 Repository with information and resources for getting started using GitHub and R, along with the best practices for working in the MoteCHaDLab GitHub organization. 
 
 Disclaimer: I (Sara) am fairly new to collaborating on code using GitHub. This will be messy and we will learn together. Google is your (our) best friend.

* Branch: version of the repository that diverges from the main working project
* Clone: make a copy of the target repository
* Fetch: gets the most updated version of a repository from the remote source
* Master:
